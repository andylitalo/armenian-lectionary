"""Reviewed source-vs-cache reading corrections.

The governing principle is that a reading must be derivable from the Tōnats'oyts
canonical rubric, and the sacredtradition.am scrape (dev/reference_data/*.json) is a
TEST ORACLE only. Where the digitized Tōnats'oyts and the cache disagree and the source
is confidently correct (reviewed by the maintainer), the engine serves the SOURCE value
and these registries record the discrepancy so the residue tooling scores the source-
faithful output as correct rather than as a "miss" against a cache typo.

## Pre-Lent cohort (Sargis / Atom / Sukias / Voskian / Ghevond), First Vol pp.464-465

Every discrepancy here is a systematic ±1 verse-boundary / versification convention
difference (the pericope is the same); see docs/sources/tonatsooyts-prelent-cohort.md
for the grabar transcription and provenance. The cache uses a slightly different
Wisdom-of-Solomon numbering (source = cache + 1) and inclusive/exclusive endpoint
convention for a couple of Gospels.

IMPORTANT: two of these reading strings ("John 16.1-4", "Luke 12.4-9") ALSO occur on
unrelated feasts (Gayiane, the summer martyrs, All Saints) where the cache is authoritative
and the source itself uses that very range -- so these corrections are applied ONLY on the
days the engine ships from the pre-Lent cohort tier (Source == "first-volume-cohort"),
never globally.
